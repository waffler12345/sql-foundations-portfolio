OVERVIEW:

This repository contains a selection of SQL queries I completed while working through the SQLBolt tutorials. The goal is to demonstrate fundamental SQL concepts in a clear, organized way.

The raw queries are saved in queries.sql

🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

-Selecting specific columns with SELECT
-Filtering rows using WHERE
-Sorting and limiting results with ORDER BY + LIMIT
-Aggregating data with COUNT(), AVG(), SUM()
-Grouping with GROUP BY and filtering groups with HAVING
-Joining tables with INNER JOIN

📂 Files
queries.sql
 → raw SQL queries grouped by concept.

📝 Notes
Queries are adapted directly from SQLBolt exercises.
This repository marks the end of the SQL Foundations stage in my data analysis roadmap.
Future sections will include more advanced SQL (aggregates, multi-table joins, projects) and be saved in their own repositories.
